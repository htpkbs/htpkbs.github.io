Check out a couple of our projects on GitHub! The [pin-check](https://github.com/htpkbs/pin-check) is a small PCB that uses all through-hole components and is intended to be used as a controller for hand-wired keyboard builds. The [orch](https://github.com/htpkbs/orch) is a mostly ortholinear 4-row keyboard (plus an arrow key cluster and function key column) that should fit most GMK keycap sets.
